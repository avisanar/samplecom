  <h3><u>
    How Important is Company Culture?</u>
  </h3><br>
  <p>
    Culture should be a fundamental consideration when making a career change. If you don't put yourself in an environment where you will thrive, neither you nor your company will grow to its fullest potential. Having the right skill set is the cost of entry, very important and necessary, but fitting into the company's culture is the critical driver of success.

    It's Business. It's Personal

</u>
  </h3><br>
  <p>
    From the moment you step into Stout Executive Search’s office, you get a sense that the business is different. The front door that opens into the office is large and industrial, with the company’s newly updated logo fashioned across it. The office appears more like a contemporary art gallery than a recruiting office, yet it has all the traditional touches of a business that’s been making its mark on the community for the past 10 years.

    Attention to Quality Customer Service Yields High Returns (Commentary)

  <p>
Customer service. Two words that when heard bring either really bad experiences or really good experiences to mind. We want the wait staff to get it right the first time. Medium well please, not medium rare and still mooing. And hurry. We want our fine dining experience quick and efficient. We want all surfaces spotless, shiny and clean.

    When Applying for Jobs, Distinguish Yourself From the Crowd

</u>
  </h3><br>
  <p>
Q: When applying for a position, what can you do to help distinguish yourself from the crowd?<br>
A: Know your brand. Answer the question: Why should this company choose you? Instead of just restating your job responsibilities focus on your results. Unless you had a very unique position, your job title likely states the obvious.  </p><br>

    Retail Suppliers Get Stout in Searches

Stout Executive Search opened its doors in November. Dealing strictly with vendors to Wa-lMart Stores Inc., owner Marvelyn Stout has tapped into a growing niche, as well as her own strong suit. She has an “overexperienced” team of four, but said she will soon add more staff to keep up with business. And to accommodate the growing demand, will absorb adjacent office space.
